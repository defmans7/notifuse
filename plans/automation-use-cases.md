## 1. Welcome Series

**Description:** A sequence of emails sent to new subscribers or users to introduce your brand, set expectations, and build initial engagement.

**Trigger:** Contact added to list / User signs up

**Example Workflow:**

2. **Day 2** - What to expect: Overview of content/products they'll receive
3. **Day 4** - Best content/products: Showcase top offerings
4. **Day 7** - Social proof: Customer stories, reviews, community links

**Best Practices:**
- Send first email within minutes of signup
- Keep emails focused on value, not selling (yet)
- Set expectations for email frequency
- Include easy unsubscribe option

## 2. Abandoned Cart Recovery

**Description:** Remind shoppers about items left in their cart to recover potentially lost sales.

**Trigger:** Cart abandonment event (1-3 hours after leaving site)

**Example Workflow:**
1. **1-3 hours** - Gentle reminder: "You left something behind"
2. **24 hours** - Create urgency: "Items selling fast" + show cart contents
3. **48-72 hours** - Final push: Offer discount or free shipping

**Best Practices:**
- Include product images and prices
- Show total cart value
- Add customer reviews of abandoned products
- Test discount timing (some brands skip discounts in first email)
- Average recovery rate: 5-15% of abandoned carts

## 3. Post-Purchase + Review Request

**Description:** Follow up after purchase to thank customers, help them get value from their purchase, and request reviews.

**Trigger:** Order completed / Item delivered (3-7 days after)

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Immediately** - Order confirmation (transactional)
2. **Shipping** - Tracking information (transactional)

## 4. Re-engagement / Winback

**Description:** Reconnect with dormant subscribers or customers who haven't engaged recently.

**Trigger:** Inactivity (30-90 days since last open/click/purchase)

**Example Workflow:**
1. **30 days inactive** - "We miss you" + what's new
2. **45 days inactive** - Special offer: Exclusive discount to return
3. **60 days inactive** - Final notice: "Should we remove you from the list?"
4. **90 days inactive** - Automatic list cleanup (unsubscribe)

**Best Practices:**
- Segment by engagement level (email vs purchase inactivity)
- Show what they're missing (new products, content)
- Use clear subject lines ("We miss you", "Still there?")
- Clean list of non-responders to maintain deliverability

## 5. Onboarding Sequence

**Description:** Guide new users through product setup and key features to drive activation and reduce churn.

**Trigger:** User activates account / Starts trial

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Immediately** - Welcome + first key action to take
2. **Day 1** - Complete profile/setup guide
3. **Day 3** - Feature spotlight: Show core value feature
4. **Day 5** - Success stories: How others use the product
5. **Day 7** - Check-in: Offer help if stuck

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on ONE action per email
- Use progress indicators ("You're 60% set up!")
- Skip emails if user already completed the action
- Link to help docs/support for complex steps

## 6. Birthday / Anniversary

**Description:** Celebrate customer milestones with personalized messages and special offers.

**Trigger:** Date field (birthday, signup anniversary, first purchase anniversary)

2. **On the day** - Birthday email with gift/discount
3. **7 days after** - Reminder: "Your gift expires soon"

**Best Practices:**
- Collect birthday during signup (just month/day is enough)
- Make offers feel exclusive and personal
- Set reasonable expiration (2-4 weeks)
- Celebrate signup anniversaries if no birthday data

---

## 7. Browse Abandonment

**Description:** Re-engage visitors who viewed products but didn't add to cart.

**Trigger:** Product viewed but not added to cart (exit without cart action)

**Example Workflow:**
1. **4-24 hours** - "Still thinking about [product]?"
2. **48 hours** - Related/similar products recommendation
3. **72 hours** - Social proof: Reviews for viewed products

**Best Practices:**
- Less aggressive than cart abandonment (lower intent)
- Focus on product education and reviews
- Show similar or complementary products
- Requires website tracking integration
- Skip if user returns and purchases

1. **Immediately on restock** - "[Product] is back!" with direct link
2. **24 hours** - Reminder: "Selling fast, don't miss out"

**Best Practices:**
- Send immediately when restocked

5. **Day of expiration** - Expired notice + easy reactivation link

**Best Practices:**
