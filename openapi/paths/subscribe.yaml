    summary: Subscribe to email lists
    description: |
      Subscribe a contact to one or more email lists. This is a public endpoint that doesn't require authentication.

      **Important:** For unauthenticated requests, only **public lists** can be subscribed to. If you need to subscribe to private lists, provide a valid `email_hmac` in the contact object (used by the notification center for re-subscribing after unsubscribing).

      If the list has double opt-in enabled, a confirmation email will be sent.
